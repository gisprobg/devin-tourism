                                <p>The potential for tourism in the municipality is based on:</p>
                                <ul>

                                </ul>
                                <p>In 2014 the municipality has 2011 beds, 715 of which class "A", 793 class "B" and 126 hunting cabins and chalets.</p>
                                <p>Only in 2013 the municipality had 62 656 reservations.</p>
                                <p>In the developed Master Plan of the municipality there are 4 tourist zones:</p>
                                <ol type="I">

                                <p>Two of the "100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria" are located near the village of Trigrad:</p>
                                <p>The Dyavolsko garlo cave (Devil's Throat) - situated at 1,8 km north of the village. The cave's entrance resembles a devil's head and down its throat rushes a massive waterfall that from ancient times has captivated imaginations and given birth to numerous legends. The most impressive part of the cave is its 42 meters high underground waterfall. An artificial tunnel leads to the so called Noisy Hall where the waters of Trigrad river drop down through the natural entrance of the cave.</p>
                                <p>The Trigrad Gorge - a 7 kilometer defile north of the village, located beneath towering marble cliffs cut over millions of years by the Trigrad river. It's west wall reaches 300 meters in height while the east one extends up to 300-3500 meters. Initially, the two walls are 300 meters apart but the gorge narrows to about 100 meters in the northern section.</p>

                                <p>Via Militaris or Via Diagonalis was an ancient Roman road, starting from Singidunum (today the Serbian capital Belgrade), passing by Danube coast to Viminacium (mod. Požarevac), through Naissus (mod. Niš), Serdica (mod. Sofia), Philippopolis (mod. Plovdiv), Adrianopolis (mod. Edirne in Turkish Thrace), and reaching Constantinople (mod. Istanbul). This road was connected with Via Egnatia by other roads - the road along river Axios (or Vardar), the Serdica–Thessalonica road along river Strymon (or Struma), and the road Philippopolis–Philippi.</p>
                                <p>It was built in the 1st century AD. The length from Singidunum to Constantinople was 924 kilometres.</p>
                                <p>During the first European conquests of Ottoman Turks orta kol (lit. middle arm) was following the Via Militaris.</p>
                                <p>In May 2010, while work was done on the Pan-European Corridor X in Serbia, well-preserved remains of the road were excavated in Dimitrovgrad, Serbia. The eight-metre wide road was constructed from large blocks of stone and had two lanes.</p>
